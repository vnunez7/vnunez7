### Hi, I'm Victoria! ðŸ‘‹

##### Bio
###### I am an undergraduate junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. My journey into tech has been non-linear, but over the past few years I have developed a strong passion in full stack development, and actively immerse myself into programs and opportunities that allow me to broaden my skillset and gain experience building production-level code using an efficient software development lifecycle. I enjoy self-learning new frameworks and languages in my free time, utilizing whatever internet resources I can to build my knowledge in the field of tech. Whatever I do not know, I make up in my willingness to learn!
